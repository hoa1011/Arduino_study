Tutorial (How to use my Arduino_study as your reference)
- You can use Proteus ver 8.6 or higher ver to simulate everything in "Simulation" file. Besides, you should read my NOTES in my Simulation because there are some of simulations i can't make in Proteus so i use Tinkercad instead.
- Remember to add file Hex first before simulating.
- If you can't find file Hex then open my code in Arduino, compile it again then find your file Hex on your computer then add to your simulation.
