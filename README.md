Tutorial (How to use my Arduino_study as your reference)
- You can use Proteus with a higher version than 8.6 to simulate everything in "Simulation" file.
- Remember to add file Hex first before simulating.
- If you can't find file Hex then open my code in Arduino, compile it again then find your file Hex on your computer then add to your simulation.
